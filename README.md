# WonderSwan TimingTest V0.1.0

This is a program to test the timing of the CPU in a Bandai WonderSwan.

## How to use:
	Use X4 (Left) & X2 (Right) to switch between pages.
	The result values are number of scanlines to run the test loop for each test, the tests are run 1000 times right now which means that the number of clock cycles x 4 almost should be the test result.
	I have run the test on my Pink WonderSwan Color to get the results.
